# FAQ

### Alright, I've added the bot to my server. Now what do I do?

Wait around to [claim a waifu](Claiming). Don't just sit there idly, thoughâ€”waifus will only spawn if you are talking! You should also take a look at the ``w.help`` command and the configurative section of it.

### Nothing is spawning!

If nothing is spawning then it is either one of three problems: nobody is talking, the bot does not have permissions, or the bot is broken. It is more than likely to be the first two than the third. Talk, make some noise. Run ``w.diagnostics`` to check if WaifuBot has a healthy amount of channels to view.

### I've claimed waifus, what do I do with them?

Trade, interact, fight. You'll have no fun using WaifuBot by yourself, so go and get some friends to use it as well.

### This seems a bit boring.

Yeah, maybe it is. Maybe you can try suggesting some new features with ``w.suggest``? Or maybe go directly to the [suggestions webform](https://flandre.cirno.pw/suggest.php).

### I want a character added to the bot, what do?

Use ``w.suggestcharacter <MyAnimeList Character URL>``. I'll add them if they aren't obscure. I have no plans to add suggestions from outside of MyAnimeList for two reasons: the database is already locked to MyAnimeList IDs and I have no motivation to change it, and I plan to keep the bot anime-only.

### I got the right name for the character, why won't it work?

The names on MAL are romanized differently from subtitles sometimes. Since the bot pulls from MAL, it is the same on the bot. Use ``w.lookup <partial name>`` if you are having difficulty with the name.

### Is there any individual value to waifus? Are all waifus of one character the same?

Each waifu has individual stats, take a look at [List](List) and [Your Waifu](Waifu).

### What the hell is CSI?

CSI is just an average of all four stats. I call it CSI because "average" is quite long and CSI sounds cool.

### Interact all feature when?

Never. Do not ask again.

### Development seems pretty slow. Can I help?

I'm a one man team. I don't have time to work on the bot every day. You can keep your dirty hands off my code, I don't trust anybody with it.

### What are the spawn rates for all of the characters? Is any character more rare than another?

They're all the same. 

### Why isn't the bot open source?

I want certain implementation details to remain hidden. The code is also an absolute mess.
