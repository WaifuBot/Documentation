# J-List Boxes

The coveted J-List Box. A good source of WeebPoints, if you ever find one. If you're lucky, you'll also get a waifu from opening one. Hell yeah.

You'll find boxes in more populated servers with high chat activity; they will not spawn in smaller servers.

## Opening a Box

Free WeebPoints is cool and all, but how do you open the box? It's pretty self-explanatory: just type out the case-sensitive combination on the picture. However, you will need the correct color key to open it.

## Keys

In order to open a box, you must have keys. Keys can be obtained through the ``w.dailykeys`` commandâ€”four keys can be claimed daily. All keys have a color, and boxes require a key of the same color to open. You can figure out which color you need by looking at the strip on the left side of the embed or looking in the embed text for the color required. If you can't remember what keys you have, check them with ``w.keys``.
