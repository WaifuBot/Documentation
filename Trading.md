Person A has a waifu that Person B wants. Person B has a waifu that Person A wants. What do they do in this situation? The answer is simple: trade. There's already an embed that comes up detailing how to trade when you use the trade command without any arguments—``w.trade``—but I'm going to add it here anyway.

# General Flow of a Trade

Begin a trade:

User 1: ``w.trade start <@User 2>``

Have the other user accept the trade:

User 2: ``w.trade accept <@User 1>``

Add/remove offers from the trade:

User 1 & 2: ``w.trade ao/ro <local waifu id>``

Confirm the trade:

User 1 & 2: ``w.trade confirm``

# Things to Note While Trading

- Affection is reset for all waifus in the trade.

- There is a limit of ten waifus per party in the trade.
