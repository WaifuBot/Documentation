# Your Waifu

When you claim a waifu, you are not claiming the character. You are claiming an instance of the character: a waifu. Every waifu exists independently of its character; think of the waifu as a car and the character as the model of car. Every waifu has individual stats, rarity, and cooldowns.

In order to view your waifu, use ``w.view <local id>``. All of their stats will appear in the embed.

## ID

## Type

## Agility, Endurance, Defence, Strength, CSI

CSI is just a mean value for all stats; I named it CSI because it sounds cool.

## Affection
