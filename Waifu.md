# Your Waifu

When you claim a waifu, you are not claiming the character. You are claiming an instance of the character: a waifu. Every waifu exists independently of its character; think of the waifu as a blue ball and the character as a box of blue balls. Every waifu has individual stats, rarity, and cooldowns.
