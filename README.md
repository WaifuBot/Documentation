# WaifuBot Documentation

![waifubot](https://i.imgur.com/D6uJPhX.png)

## Introduction

This is the full, comprehensive (but not really) WaifuBot documentation. All sorts of useful information can be found in this document:

- An outline of a myriad of issues you may encounter while using the bot and instructions on how to fix them
- A brief beginner's guide to the bot
- Documentation for most of the bot's commands

You may peruse this text in its entirety (not recommended) or skim through it using the sidebar.

Typing "waifus and husbandos" is quite cumbersome, so I will be referring to all waifus/husbandos as waifus in this documentation.

All commands in this documentation are displayed with the default ``.w`` prefix. If a server has changed the prefix, the default prefix will not work. Substitute ``.w`` with the server's prefix.

## Mission

Why did I create WaifuBot? WaifuBot was created as a memeâ€”and it still is. Even through 17 thousand servers, WaifuBot is still a meme. Even through the hours of development and hardships encountered creating it, WaifuBot is still a meme. And I am aiming to make WaifuBot the most epic meme possible.
