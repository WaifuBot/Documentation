# Donations

Current cost of WaifuBot hosting: $27/mo for the VPS that the bot is run on, $10/yr for the image server, $22/yr for the domains (cirno.pw, waifubot.net). I do not seek to gain a profit from this botâ€”WaifuBot is something that I created for fun and expecting to earn profit from a Discord bot is ridiculous. All donations are used exclusively for the bot's server and related expenses.

## Accepted Methods of Payment

Only one: Bitcoin.


You can send some bitcoin to my bitcoin address, and I'll use it to pay server expenses for the bot.


Send BTC to the following address:

## What do I get?

You will not get anything special, just a CashMoney role on the support server if you donate over $5 and a promotional untradable KappaU rarity waifu of your choice for every $5 donated. Message me on Discord beforehand when you donate.

## B-but why can't I use Patreon or PayPal

Bitcoin is a secure method of payment and I like it. Patreon is a stupid monetization platform and I do not like it.

If you're too small brain for BTC just use VirWox to buy some with PayPal, no big deal:

## You won't use the cash I sent you to buy crack from the deep web, right?
Probably not.
